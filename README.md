### How does it work?

Type in a word, and Word Lapse will tell you information about how that word has changed per year in terms of associated words or frequency of use.

The data for this website was generated by training multiple Word2Vec models on 30+ million documents from [Pubtator Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/).
Word2Vec is a natural language processing (NLP) model that represents words in dense vectors (300 dimensions).
This model constructs these dense vectors by training a shallow neural network to accomplish the NLP task of predicting a word given their neighboring words.
Once trained, every unique word is now associated with a dense vector, which can be used for downstream analyses.

Word2Vec model is unstable, and we took an intra-year and inter-year approach to account for this instability.
We trained ten different Word2Vec models on documents sorted by each publication year.
Next, we generated combination pairs for every model trained within a given year and calculated the intra-year distance, which consists of calculating the [cosine distance](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/cosine-similarity-cosine-distance-6571387f9bf8) for every token within each model pair
Following intra-year distance, we calculated the inter-year distance by taking the same approach described above for two different years rather than the same year.
Lastly, we took the ratio of inter-year distance over intra-year distance and any values over a threshold is considered to be a changepoint.
